## 11. Open Questions & Next Steps
- ~~Establish collaboration model: single-tenant deployment (one organization) for MVP; document path to multi-tenant isolation later.~~ (MVP decision made)
- ~~Define integration approach with upstream Mellea tooling (Python APIs preferred, CLI fallback) for program detection and execution orchestration.~~ (Use Python APIs first, CLI later)
- ~~Research deeper mellea interfaces (CLI/SDK) for program/composition orchestration beyond `main.py` convention.~~ (Plan to leverage Mellea Python APIs for session/contracts + expose optional CLI hooks)
- ~~Clarify long-term storage/backup approach for filesystem-backed assets (e.g., NFS vs. object store abstraction) and disaster recovery expectations.~~ (Use shared NFS with daily snapshots; evaluate object storage later)
- ~~Decide on UI framework/component library standard for the playground.~~ (Use React + Chakra UI for MVP)
- ~~Define safeguards against malicious code (sandboxing, monitoring) when running shared programs.~~ (See Section 4 "Container Security & Isolation" for MVP approach; gVisor/Firecracker evaluation tracked for pre-public-gallery hardening)
- ~~Specify execution UX protocol (e.g., server-sent events vs. websockets) and artifact retention policy.~~ (SSE + 14-day retention for MVP)
- ~~Establish quota enforcement strategy (CPU hours, concurrent runs) once limits are finalized.~~ (Track usage metrics now; defer automated enforcement until scale requires it)
- ~~Plan dataset/prompt management model for future evaluations, including sharing permissions.~~ (Use central registry with versioning + asset-level sharing controls)
- ~~Determine external API/automation surface for triggering runs or syncing assets (CI/CD integration).~~ (Start GUI-only; plan REST/webhook APIs in later phase)
- ~~Assess need for multi-region or high-availability deployment strategies.~~ (Single-region MVP; revisit HA/multi-region when usage demands)
