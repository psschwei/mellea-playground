# 1. Playground Overview

- **Goal**: Provide a centralized GUI playground to catalog, run, and compose mellea programs across multiple LLMs.
- **Users**: Individual builders and collaborators who author programs, share assets, and orchestrate multi-model experiments.
- **Core Pillars**: Catalog & metadata, import/creation, isolated environments, execution observability, visual orchestration, AI-assisted authoring, collaboration, future evaluations.
- **Architecture Snapshot**: Typed backend service layer (e.g., Python/FastAPI or TypeScript) fronting a filesystem-backed asset store, Kubernetes for container orchestration, UI framework TBD.
